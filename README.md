# LingCode Input Method Framework

LingCode is a Rust-based input method framework that aims to provide a flexible and efficient way to input Chinese characters using Pinyin (Simplified and Traditional) and Double Pinyin. This project is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

## Features

- **Pinyin Input**: Supports both Simplified and Traditional Pinyin input methods.
- **Double Pinyin**: Implements Double Pinyin input for efficient typing.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with major operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
- **Modular Design**: Built with a modular architecture, allowing easy extension and customization.
- **Rime-Compatible**: Leverages resources and schemas from the Rime input method ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LingCode project, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd LingCode
cargo build --workspace
```

### Setting Up Resources

LingCode uses resources from the Rime input method ecosystem. To set up resources:

```bash
# Clone Rime resource repositories
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/rime/rime-prelude.git
git clone https://github.com/rime/rime-luna-pinyin.git
git clone https://github.com/rime/rime-double-pinyin.git

# Copy resource files to appropriate directories
cp rime-prelude/*.yaml schemas/
cp rime-luna-pinyin/*.yaml schemas/
cp rime-luna-pinyin/*.yaml dicts/
cp rime-double-pinyin/*.yaml schemas/
```

For detailed information about resources, see [docs/RESOURCES.md](docs/RESOURCES.md).
